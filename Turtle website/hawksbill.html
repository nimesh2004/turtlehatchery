<h1>Charactaristics</h1>
<p>These turtles are relatively small sea turtles. Young hawksbill turtles have a heart-shaped carapace. As these turtles mature, they have generally flattened body shape & carapaces become more elongated. The lateral and posterior areas of the carapace are serrated in all of these turtles, except very old individuals. The heads of hawksbill turtles taper into a V shape, giving them the appearance of birds' beaks. Its flipper-like arms are adapted for swimming in the open ocean.</p>
<h1>Breeding</h1>
<p>The reproductive maturity of a female occurs in 3 years. Mating occurs roughly every 2 to 3 years. Copulation usually begins in shallow water near the shore. Males lie and wait in the shallow water for the females to return. Some times, males follow the females on shore.

    Nesting generally occurs between April-June & December-January. Nesting females average a length of 87 cm in curved carapace length and weigh 80 kg. The entire nesting process takes roughly one to three hours. After mating, the females drag their heavy bodies high onto the beach during the night. Their gestation period is around 60 days (average).
    
    They clear out an area and dig a nesting hole using their rear flippers. Next they lay their eggs and then proceed to fill in the pit in with their hind limbs. After the site is disguised, the turtles return to the sea. The females lay 3 clutches a year at an interval of roughly 13-15 days. The eggs measure 30-35mm. Sex determination is thought to be temperature-dependent. The baby turtles, usually weighing less than two dozen grams, hatch during the night after around 2 months. Around 96-177 offspring are produced without any parent involvement. They instinctually head for the sea, attracted by the reflection of the moon on the water.</p>
