    <h1 id="heading1">Description</h1>
    <p>The Green Turtle is the most commonly found turtle in Sri Lanka. They are also found in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Their English name refers to the colour of the fat found under their shells, which unfortunately is used to make turtle soup. Luckily this practice is less common today. Young Green Turtles are mainly carnivores. Adults however are herbivores, feeding only on marine vegetation with the help of their finely serrated jaws.</p>
    <h1>Breeding</h1>
    <p>The mating seasons vary between populations, taking place throughout the year. Individual female green turtles usually mate every 2-4 years. But there is an increase in January to March. Female turtles control mating; males cannot force females to mate. There is an increased survival among the hatchlings but only a few green turtle populations are known to undergo polyandry when mating.
        After mating in the water, the females haul themselves onto the beach above the high tide line. Upon reaching a suitable nesting site, the gravid female digs a hole with her hind flippers and deposits a number of eggs in the nest & the number laid per litter depends on the age of the female. After laying eggs, the female covers the nest with sand and returns to the sea.
        Eggs are soft shelled & spherical. Each nest contains 98-172 eggs measure 41.4-42.1mm. The hatchlings occur after 2 months of time. During a nesting season, one female can lay up to 11 nests. The eggs hatch during the night and the newly-emerged turtles instinctively head directly towards the water's edge. After hatching, turtles in their first five years are known to spend a majority of their early life stages in convergence zones within the open ocean.</p>
