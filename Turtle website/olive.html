<h1>Breeding</h1>
<p>Females choose to return to their beach of birth and will do this by remembering the smell of the beach through enhanced chemo sensors. Efforts are made to protect the eggs and hatchlings there should be rises in the numbers returning to nest in future.

    Females usually reach a length of 60 cm before becoming reproductively active. They are not monogamous. Male sperm is stored within the female for use throughout the entire breeding season. Mating takes place just offshore of the breeding beaches. Nesting takes place during the night with the females riding in on the high tide and usually coincides with the first or last quarter of the moon.
    
    The Olive Ridley turtle is well known for its mass nesting, with 300 or more females at a time coming ashore. Situating themselves approximately 50 m from the sea, females will dig a nest 30-55 cm deep, depositing on average 107 eggs, and then return to the sea. This entire process takes the female turtles less then an hour. Since females store sperm in their bodies for later use, a single female can nest multiple months in a row.
    
    The eggs measure 34-43mm and hatch within 45-51 days depending on incubation temperatures. Temperature determines the sex of the turtle. The hatchlings measure 37.9-49.9mm.</p>
