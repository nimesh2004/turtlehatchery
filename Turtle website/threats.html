<h1>Threats to marine turtles</h1>
    <h2>Killed for meat and shells</h2><br>
    <p>  Marine turtles are killed for their meat in many countries. In Sri Lanka, slaughter of marine turtles for meat is a traditional practice in many coastal areas. Slaughter of nesting adult females directly effects the reduction of the turtle population. Live turtles entangled in fishing gears are also slaughtered by for flesh by the fishermen.</p>
    <p>The highly endangered Hawksbill turtles have been killed in many parts of the world for its beautiful shell or carapace to provide raw material for the ‘’tortoise shell’’ trade. When scutes are removed from the shell, the turtle eventually dies. Synthetic fibres with similar colour patterns are now available to replace the tortoiseshell dies. Synthetic fibres with similar colour patterns are now available to replace the tortoiseshell raw materials for the good sake of hawksbill turtles.</p>

    <h3>How we can prevent it </h3><br>
    <p>In order to prevent the harvesting of turtle meat and eggs, goverments and other conservatives could educate the public about the ecological value of turtles and implement strict penalties for those who are caught engaging in illegal hunting or trade of turtle products. Forthermore they could educate them on not only why but how they can contribute to the conservation of turtles.</p><br>

    <h2>Habitat distruction</h2><br>
<p>Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Uncontrolled coastal development, vehicle traffic on beaches, and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed sea turtle nesting beaches around the world. For example, lights from roads and buildings disorient hatchlings away from the sea, and vehicle traffic on beaches compacts the sand, making it impossible for female turtles to dig nests. Turtle feeding grounds such as coral reefs and seagrass beds are damaged and destroyed by activities onshore, including sedimentation from clearing of land and nutrient run-off from agriculture. Beach restoration projects for protecting seaside buildings have also been found to be harmful, through dredging and sand filling.</p>

<h3>How we can prevent it</h3><br>
<p>in order to conserve the turtle habitat governments should restrict human activities in coastal areas that directly  affect turtle nesting and foraging habitats. Furthermore, governments should limit or prohibit coastal constructions such as ports, and coastal tourism infrastructure. This can lead to water and soil pollution, which can destroy the sensitive marine ecosystems that turtles depend on.</p><br>

<h2>Pollution</h2><br>
<p>Sea turtles can mistake floating plastic materials for jellyfish and can choke on them when they try to eat them. These encounters are often fatal. Lost or discarded fishing gear—called ghost gear—entangles sea turtles and can drown or render a turtle unable to feed or swim. Trash on beaches can trap hatchlings and prevent them from reaching the ocean. Oil spills also poison sea turtles of all ages.</p>

    <h3>How to prevent it</h3>
<p>we can reduce the sea pollution by implementing laws that restrict people from taking littering any materials into the sea or on beaches. Furthermore, beach cleanup programs and public awareness campaigns can also be helpful in reducing sea pollution.</p>
