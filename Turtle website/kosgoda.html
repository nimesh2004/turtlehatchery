    <h1 id="heading">Kosgoda turtle hatchery</h1>
    <p>This is the oldest Conservation and Research project started in Sri Lanka in early 1978. It was at a time when all 7 species of sea turtles were on the Endangered list. Of the 7 species, 5 of the species were found to be frequenting the beaches of the southern coast of Sri Lanka where they beached, to lay their eggs. These eggs were collected by the villagers and sold in the open market.

        It was about this time when the famous Swedish camera maker Victor Hasselblad whose cameras were the first to be used on the moon, came into the picture. He happened to be a close friend of the highly renowned Sri Lankan bird photographer, Dr Upane de Zylva , and Victor, having similar interests in photography, had made a donation through Dr Zylva to be used in any form of conservation and research, in Sri Lanka.
        
        The late Dr. Siri Wickremesinghe, happened to be close friend of Dr Zylva. Dr. Wickremesinghe, like his friend,had similar interests in wild life and nature and the two of them decided that a turtle conservation project would be the best. It so happened that Dr Zylva knew Similiyas Abbrew, father of Chandrasiri and grandfather of Isuru, and when he told him about their intended project, he was only too happy to give part of his property to build the hatchery. Nape, in Kosgoda was a favourite beach for the turtles to lay their eggs, and so it all fell into place. Thanks to Victor Hasselblad and Dr.Zylva and Dr. Wickremesinghe, the turtles have found a safe haven and they are increasing in numbers. It is a wonderful experience to see the hatchlings, once released on the beach, rushing to catch the first wave!</p>

        <h1>The hatchery works in the following steps: </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Staff patrols beach at nights looking for mother sea turtles that come out of the sea to lay eggs.</li>
            <li>They protect the mother from afar during the nesting process, until she finishes laying the eggs and returns to the ocean.</li>
            <li>The eggs are relocated from beach to hatchery to protect them from predators and irresponsible human action.</li>
            <li>In addition fishermen are also paid to bring any turtle eggs they find to the hatchery.</li>
            <li>The eggs develop and hatch in a protected area. This may take between 45-60 days.</li> 
        </ul>
